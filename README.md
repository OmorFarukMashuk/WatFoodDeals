# WatFoodDeals

Maintaining budget while keeping the appetit healthy and satisfactory is the biggest challenge a student face during his grad life.
Knocking several food corners or even googling down every single time manually takes a lot of time during a busy schedule. 
Eventhough, getting a cheap but quality food is possible always to find, nothing can beat a trustworthy recommendation combining 
nearby food stores containing all the offers in a particular day. Perhaps, an app can solve the issue immediately.

# Getting Started

Following the instructions below will guide someone copying and running this project at a personal computer. 

# Prerequisites


*  Minimum requierment iOS 10 or higher to run the app 
*  Xcode V9 or higher and swift 4 or higher for running this in a personal computer

# Installing

Please follow the steps below:

*  Dowload Xcode and swift (latest one)
*  MacOS operating system (mandatory)

# Running and Test

Will be explained later on how to run the automated test for the system


# Deployment

It will be tested into iOS environment and iphone

# Build with

*  Swift V4 and Xcode V9











To achieve the task, initially, a dummy database will be created (in SQL if necessary) and synched to iOS paradigm. User, in this 
case a waterloo student, after logging in will be able to select a particular date, food preference and time. Based on the 
preselection, all nearby restaurant offers will be viewed there. Moreover, the student is also entitled to put his budget for an 
entire week, based on that, a comprehensive summary will be given to him at the beginning of the week. 

There will be three users of this software. A moderator, a supervisor receiving and modifying the server information as per the 
latest update from the restaurants and finally, the student. 

In summary, the app will prioritize the budget of the student, but not limited to recommendation only. Restaurant location, close 
proximity suggestion, suggestion regarding adding little more at the budget to have a great meal and some other features will also 
be included. 


This repository contains the swift code and design of an iOS app for food menu recommendation for waterloo students. 

At it's core it holds several features:
1. User information and preference
2. Recommendaiton based on pre-selected preferences

As a running example, a dummy database is used, but in real world, it is intended to aid waterloo students requiring quality foods at waterloo
plaza restaurants within affordable price.
