This repository contains the swift code and design of an iOS app for food menu recommendation for waterloo students. 

At it's core it holds several features:
1. User information and preference
2. Recommendaiton based on pre-selected preferences

As a running example, a dummy database is used, but in real world, it is intended to aid waterloo students requiring quality foods at waterloo
plaza restaurants within affordable price.
