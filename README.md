Maintaining budget while keeping the appetit healthy and satisfactory is the biggest challenge a student face during his grad life.
Knocking several food corners or even googling down every single time manually takes a lot of time during a busy schedule. 
Eventhough, getting a cheap but quality food is possible always to find, nothing can beat a trustworthy recommendation combining 
nearby food stores containing all the offers in a particular day. Perhaps, an app can solve the issue immediately. 

Keeping the aforementioned into consideration, weâ€™ve decided to build an iOS app for waterloo students combining the daily special 
offers at waterloo plaza restaurants or food chains. A student with his valid student Id can log into the account and get all the 
food offers at waterloo plaza within a blink of an eye. Even, he will be able to customize his preference for a particular day in 
advance, so that he can get an recommendation and reminder beforehand. 

To achieve the task, initially, a dummy database will be created (in SQL if necessary) and synched to iOS paradigm. User, in this 
case a waterloo student, after logging in will be able to select a particular date, food preference and time. Based on the 
preselection, all nearby restaurant offers will be viewed there. Moreover, the student is also entitled to put his budget for an 
entire week, based on that, a comprehensive summary will be given to him at the beginning of the week. 

There will be three users of this software. A moderator, a supervisor receiving and modifying the server information as per the 
latest update from the restaurants and finally, the student. 

In summary, the app will prioritize the budget of the student, but not limited to recommendation only. Restaurant location, close 
proximity suggestion, suggestion regarding adding little more at the budget to have a great meal and some other features will also 
be included. 


This repository contains the swift code and design of an iOS app for food menu recommendation for waterloo students. 

At it's core it holds several features:
1. User information and preference
2. Recommendaiton based on pre-selected preferences

As a running example, a dummy database is used, but in real world, it is intended to aid waterloo students requiring quality foods at waterloo
plaza restaurants within affordable price.
